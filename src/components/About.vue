    <h1>What is this?</h1>

    <p>My name is Jared McCannon. Professionally, I'm a Sr. Software Engineer. Personally, I'm a father, husband, and all around
      tinkerer.  I enjoy reading, learning, exercise, cooking, and improving things.</p>

      <h1>What's the point of this?</h1>
      <p>The goal of this website is two fold. One part is to act as a way of recording my methods and thoughts while working
      on projects. The other part is share those findings and process with others.</p>
